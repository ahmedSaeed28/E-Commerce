- My app opens with a splash screen loading the products from the api then opens a screen where user can see and search for products
- User can't see any product until he search for it 
- Link of my mock api:
    https://5fd15a4cb485ea0016eee3ee.mockapi.io/products
- Some examples from my data for queries that help you to test the app "b", "br", "bro", "bre" and "brea"
- I added 21 items of "Brown eggs" to test feature by making the maximum number of items 20
- I added a feature that when the user dosn't search, show text where the list should appear, helps him which is "Start searching in the search bar to see Products"
